The API exposes the following endpoints:

- `POST /users` - Create a new user with 2FA disabled
- `GET /users/:userId` - Get a user data
- `POST /users/authenticate` - Authenticate a user and generate a JWT token for subsequent requests
- `POST /2fa` - Enable 2FA for a user
- `DELETE /2fa` - Disable 2FA for a user
- `POST /2fa/code` - Generate a 2FA code for a user
- `POST /2fa/validate` - Validate a 2FA code for a user

Refer to the API documentation for more details on each endpoint and their required inputs.
